# Blood-Bank-Donation-Management-System
In this project i have created multiple tables with multiple attributes each. Our purpose was to be able to have a database that stored information about the Donor, the Recipient, Medical personnel, how much and when the blood was donated, and whenever there was a transaction made between the donor, the medical personnel, and the recipient. All tables are linked together using foreign keys to  enforce relationships. We created three different views: Patient Seen, Blood Stock, and a Patient List. This adds security to the individual tables by not showing irrelevant data to unauthorized viewers.
